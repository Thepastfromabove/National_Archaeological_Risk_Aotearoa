This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of data pertaining to the research paper titled "Aotearoa's coastal archaeological heritage: a geostatistical overview of what is at stake." The paper, accessible at http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15564894.2023.2207493, delves into an in-depth analysis of Aotearoa's coastal archaeological heritage. I applied a point location obfuscation technique to the associated dataset in order to safeguard the data sovereignty and integrity of the sites involved.
